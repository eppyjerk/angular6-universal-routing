# Angular Universal routing issue

This repo is an example of a server side rendering routing issue.

This is a copy of the "finished sample code" from the angular.io guide: https://angular.io/guide/universal

# Commits

1. Direct unzip of the sample code, with the addition of this README, .gitignore and .prettierrc.  At this point, server and client rendering is working as expected.
